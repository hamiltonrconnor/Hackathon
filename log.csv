It's not finding the fight. That's why.You're notBut it's like, what here is this location. I wouldNo.Oh god. It's six dog Christ. Yeah.For. I think we will just like makehowdepends.If I get make program.Yes.I just like rage myto it feel whenever feel likewe to get somethingVery ka she's like, I'm not more too christmas Like, I I will notIthere's noupmuchand thenfull guys. You that. Yeah.Four guys like.I was safe.Thethis is the file. Like, I put it everywhere.It's like no way can't.This.Like, it's just saying it should be inPort number slash files dotlike, where do I put the?Like so it's searching firstYeah.Not finding that. I put itSo it's in the static folder. It's also in the music folder.It's just in the baseball.In the templates followed up.Like,Where does it go?Is there any way to change where it searches for it?Because there's there's never gonna befile in eighteenslash yeah If I assume that that would just be the base.My.So what... Like, if you're an Html file,like matt is the source that. That's where I've got... Where do I needit from.I I know this is what's say. Absolutely. If it'swhere would it be it's?Director. Yeah... And it works when I do it.Just as a hate html out and the right in the same directory it works.That's sopythonflashesyeah.Thathave but like from... Quite the way star is the class.LikeJust put, like, the full local pile. Yeah.I get that. How does that people work? Does that work on?There'sright? Because then like... Yeah. No. It it needs to be like, relative to something.No don't maybe on bypass.The plan is I'm just gonna keep changing the file and just have it loud loop.Loop the fire byand then just change what's in the file. Yeah.I just hope it doesn't get corrupted or something. I get just downWhat is this??As all.Project right.Yeah. Good. So if I just like, open up the hips if I just open upplain html.Oh, it's just here. That's the file.Front next to no pie. Yeah. But if I do it in the platform,Good slight across. Oh, wait becauseYeah. Yeah. Soyour viewlike, it's filed rather than being a h.Yeah.I just assume that's my fullmake some progress on something else.That canThat's why it'sBe ironic this project.Stage that's I'm offering here is simon. Because it's justNot allowed local.Go have permission tonight to tookthat was aYeah. I no if it's happening at the same time. It says oneone gets measured from one doesn't.Probably likeyou can't write to at the same timeYou think in thistruly like sequel onereading up. Yeah.Be nine.I think that doesn't make not have to complete before I get this stuff.No. IfI was gonna wait on. But can just thatfocus if an async function fire off theso just make it niceoff wait the plates on the itself.Okay. So I can replaceOkay. Let's given a list.JustsoYes.I feel like at the end of all been okay. Got. Go.Which pretend that we've missed misunderstood the briefingit's Tokyo and I use hope that.Sounds a lot of people going myThethanis already and it's about realisticYeah.NiceIt it works It makes sense right. If you're trying to reach the phoneunderstand what code doesjust still outside.I like tell that'syou think of pub girls is just like bubble gum? Mobilethat's. If I give us something I havehashtagYeah. I think this is the bestkind of adon't try and hashtagYeah like if you know likegreattake off.JesusHealth glasgowI think it's alright.
